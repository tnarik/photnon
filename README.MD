#Photo Noncer

A project to inspect picture files, read timestamps and other information from them, and organise/update the files correspondingly.

The single script `photnon.py` should be able to run as a one step or a two step process:

1. Data mining from one folder and generation of datafile
2. Analysis of datafile (with minor user input) and generation of scripts for further review before off-band execution.
