A project to inspect picture files, read timestamps and other information from them, and organise/update the files correspondingly.

Initially there were two scripts (`photos.py` to analyse the photos and `read.py` to read the analysis and update the external appearance of the photos). Now it is a single script with two actions, so that inspection can be done manually.
